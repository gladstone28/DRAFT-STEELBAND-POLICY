At the King's Gate United Church the administration offers Steel Band Training to Church members who then become members of the steel Band Group. They are now proposing that this training be extended island wide to anyone who whish to learn how to play the steel band. However the Minister has requested that a Stee Band Policy be written to ensure 
an orderly management and control of all members of the expanded Steel Band Group. He requires a proper selection process for non-members of the church. The policy should also state a clear objective for the Steels Band Group as well as strategies to use this means of expanding church membership by young people. Can you write such a policy for me?
